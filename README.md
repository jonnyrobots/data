# Data
**Data** is a repository of research data you can use to inform your product strategy

## Using Data

Data is organised into `Projects` (directories) that have three main components;

* `data-task.md`: the question, hypothesis or purpose of collecting the data in the first place
* `data-raw.csv`: the (cleaned) raw data, with source attribution 
* and `data-insight.md`: the processed data with the insight drawn from it  

## Things to note

The `data-task.md` and `data-insight.md` are provided for context only. 

The mechanisms used to build the task, collect the data and draw the insight happen outside of this repo and aren't public (not yet at least; this may change - please raise an issue to register your vote).

While it's tempting to copy-paste the insight into a strategy, I'd encourage you to focus on asking questions of the raw data in order to pull out your own insight, or draw your own conclusions.
